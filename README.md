## Hi there 👋

I am a Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in Systems and Network Engineering. My expertise includes implementing security at both the infrastructure and application levels, with a strong focus on compliance. I have hands-on experience with FIPS enablement across service images, libraries, and packages to ensure full FIPS compliance.

In addition, I possess a solid background in Blockchain and Web3 technologies. I have developed decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts for both Web3 startups and enterprise clients, contributing to secure and scalable blockchain-based solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on tftp implementation using TCP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Unix Network Programming, by W.R. Stevens](http://kohala.com/)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on remote software engineering projects or long-term opportunities where I can contribute my skills in C/C++, systems programming, and backend development.
- 💬 Ask me about C, C++, System, Network, and Blockchain.
